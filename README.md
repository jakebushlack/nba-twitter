Parse HTML, run SQL queries, tweet interesting stats

This is a personal program that will pull data from Basketball Reference, store it into a dataframe, run queries for interesting stats, and tweet the findings.

This project is strictly for my own educational purposes. There is no monetary motive attached to the Twitter account or any of the data use. I want to learn more about the python programming language, APIs, version control, and data science.
